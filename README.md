## An Introduction

Check out the [Just Getting Started](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/getting_started.html) section of the documentation!

This Arduino library gives environmental sensors a common interface of functions for use with Arduino-compatible dataloggers, such as the EnviroDIY Mayfly.
The ModularSensors library is specifically designed to support wireless, solar-powered environmental data logging applications, that is, to:
* Retrieve data from many physical sensors;
* Save that data to a SD memory card;
* Transmit that data wirelessly to a web server; and
* Put the processor, sensors and all other peripherals to sleep between readings to conserve power.

The ModularSensors library coordinates these tasks by "wrapping" native sensor libraries into a common interface of functions and returns.
These [wrapper functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrapper_function) serve to harmonize and simplify the process of iterating through and logging data from a diverse set of sensors and variables.
Using the common sensor and variable interface, the library attempts to optimize measurement timing as much as possible to reduce logger "on-time" and power consumption.

Although this library was written primarily for the [EnviroDIY Mayfly data logger board](https://envirodiy.org/mayfly/), it is also designed to be [compatible with a variety of other Arduino-based boards](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/wiki/Processor-Compatibility) as well.

There is extensive documentation available in the [ModularSensors github pages](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/index.html) including details of the class structures and example code.

## Data Endpoints

Within ModularSensors, the "dataPublisher" objects add the functionality to send data to remote web services.
The currently supported services are the [Monitor My Watershed data portal](http://data.envirodiy.org/) and [ThingSpeak](https://thingspeak.com/).

## Contributing
Open an [issue](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/issues) to suggest and discuss potential changes/additions.
Feel free to open issues about any bugs you find or any sensors you would like to have added.

If you would like to directly help with the coding development of the library, there are some [tips here](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/for_developers.html) on how to set up PlatformIO so you can fork the library and test programs while in the library repo.
Please _take time to familiarize yourself with the [terminology, classes and data structures](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/library_terminology.html) this library uses_.
This library is built to fully take advantage of Objecting Oriented Programing (OOP) approaches and is larger and more complicated than many Arduino libraries.
There is _extensive_ documentation on our [github pages](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/index.html) and an _enormous_ number of comments and debugging printouts in the code itself to help you get going.
