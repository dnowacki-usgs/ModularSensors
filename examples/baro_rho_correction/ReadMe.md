# Using ModularSensors to Calculate Results based on Measured Values

This example demonstrates how to work with calculated variables and calculates water depth by correcting the total pressure measured by a MeaSpec MS5803 with the atmospheric pressure measured by a Bosch BME280 environmental sensor and the temperature measured by a Maxim DS18 temperature probe.

The modem used in this example is a SIM800 based Sodaq GPRSBee r6.

The sensors used in this example are a Maxim DS18 temperature probe, a Bosch BME280 environmental sensor, and a Measurement Specialties MS5803-14BA pressure sensor.
