## Single Sensor

[//]: # ( @subpage single_sensor_example )

The [single_sensor](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/single_sensor) example shows making use of the unified set of commands to print data from a MaxBotix ultrasonic range finder to the serial port.
It also shows creating a calculated variable which is the water depth.

## Simple Logging

[//]: # ( @subpage simple_logging_example )

The [simple_logging](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/simple_logging) example shows how to create multiple sensors, create variables for the sensors in a variable array, and log the data from the sensors to an SD card.

## Publishing to Monitor My Watershed

[//]: # ( @subpage mmw_example )

The [logging_to_MMW](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/logging_to_MMW/logging_to_MMW.ino) example uses a Digi XBee in transparent mode to publish data live from a BME280 and Maxim DS18 to the Monitor My Watershed data portal.

## Publishing to ThingSpeak

[//]: # ( @subpage thingspeak_example )

The [logging_to_ThingSpeak](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/logging_to_ThingSpeak) example uses an ESP8266 to send data to ThingSpeak.
It also includes a Meter Hydros 21 (formerly know as a Decagon CTD) and a Campbell OBS3+.

## Barometric Pressure Correction

[//]: # ( @subpage baro_rho_example )

The [baro_rho_correction](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/baro_rho_correction) example demonstrates how to work with calculated variables and calculates water depth by correcting the total pressure measured by a MeaSpec MS5803 with the atmospheric pressure measured by a Bosch BME280 environmental sensor and the temperature measured by a Maxim DS18 temperature probe.

## Multiple Logging Intervals

[//]: # ( @subpage double_log_example )

The more complicated [double_logger](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/double_logger) example using two different logger instances to log data at two different intervals, in this case, an AM3215 logging every minute, while checking the battery voltage only every 5 minutes.
This showcases both how to use two different logging instances and how to use some of the functions to set up your own logging loop rather than using the logData() function.

##  Minimizing Cell Data Usage

[//]: # ( @subpage data_saving_example )

The [data_saving](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/) example is another double logger example, but in this case, both loggers are going at the same interval and the only difference between the loggers is the list of variables.
There are two sets of variables, all coming from Yosemitech sensors.
Because each sensor outputs temperature and we don't want to waste cellular data sending out multiple nearly identical temperature values, we have one logger that logs every possible variable result to the SD card and another logger that sends only unique results to the EnviroDIY data portal.
This example also shows how to stop power draw from an RS485 adapter with automatic flow detection.

## DRWI CitSci (2G)

[//]: # ( @subpage drwi_2g_example )

The [DRWI_CitSci](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/DRWI_CitSci) example uses the sensors and equipment standard groups participating in the DWRI Citizen Science project with the Stroud Water Research Center.
It includes a Meter Hydros 21 (formerly know as a Decagon CTD), a Campbell OBS3+, and a Sodaq GPRSBee for communication.
The results are saved to the SD card and posted to the Monitor My Watershed data portal.

## DRWI LTE

[//]: # ( @subpage drwi_lte_example )

The [DRWI_LTE](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/DRWI_LTE) example uses the sensors and equipment standard groups participating in the DWRI Citizen Science project with the Stroud Water Research Center.
It includes a Meter Hydros 21 (formerly know as a Decagon CTD), a Campbell OBS3+, and a Digi XBee3 LTE-M for communication.
The results are saved to the SD card and posted to the Monitor My Watershed data portal.

## DRWI CitSci No Cellular

[//]: # ( @subpage drwi_no_cell_example )

The [DRWI_NoCellular](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/DRWI_NoCellular) example uses the sensors and equipment standard to the DWRI Citizen Science grant but omits the data publisher for circumstances where there is no cellular signal.

## Menu a la carte

[//]: # ( @subpage menu_example )

The [menu_a_la_carte](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/tree/master/examples/menu_a_la_carte) example shows most of the functions of the library at once.
It has code in it for every possible sensor and modem and for both AVR and SAMD boards.
It is also over 1500 lines long.
This examples is intended to be used like an a la carte menu of all possible options where you selected only the portions of code pertenent to you and delete everything else.
