 * @section fivetm_intro Introduction
 *
 * Meter Environmental makes two series of soil moisture sensors, the
 * [ECH2O series](https://www.metergroup.com/environment/products/?product_category=9525) and the
 * [Teros series](https://www.metergroup.com/environment/products/teros-12/).
 * __This page is for the ECH2O series.__
 *
 * @note Meter Environmental was formerly known as Decagon Devices and sold the
 * a very similar sensor to the current EC-5 sensor as the 5TM.
 *
 * Both series of sensors operate as sub-classes of the SDI12Sensors class.
 * They require a 3.5-12V power supply, which can be turned off between
 * measurements. While contrary to the manual, they will run with power as low
 * as 3.3V. On the 5TM with a stereo cable, the power is connected to the tip,
 * data to the ring, and ground to the sleeve. On the bare-wire version, the
 * power is connected to the _white_ cable, data to _red_, and ground to the
 * unshielded cable.
