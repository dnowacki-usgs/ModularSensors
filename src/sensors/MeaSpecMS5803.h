 * @section ms5803_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Measurement Specialties MS5803 is a miniature digital pressure sensor.
 * It comes in several different pressure ranges, with 14 bar being one of the
 * most common.  Although this sensor has the option of either I2C or SPI
 * communication, this library only supports I2C.  The sensor's I2C address is
 * determined the voltage level of the CSB pin; it will be either 0x76 or 0x77.
 * Breakout boards purchased from Sparkfun are set to 0x76 while those from
 * Northern Widget are variable depending on the model as outlined in their
 * [library](https://github.com/NorthernWidget/TP-Downhole_Library). To connect
 * two of these sensors to your system, you must ensure they are soldered so as
 * to have different I2C addresses.  No more than two can be attached.  These
 * sensors should be attached to a 1.7-3.6V power source and the power supply to
 * the sensor can be stopped between measurements.
 *
 * @warning These I2C addresses are the same as those available for the Bosch
 * BME280 Barometric Pressure Sensor!  If you are also using one of those
 * sensors, make sure that the address for that sensor does not conflict with
 * the address of this sensor.
 *
 * The lower level communication between the mcu and the MS5803 is handled by the
 * [Northern Widget MS5803 library](https://github.com/NorthernWidget/MS5803).
