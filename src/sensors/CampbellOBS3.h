 *
 * @section obs3_intro Introduction
 *
 * @warning This sensor is no longer manufactured.
 *
 * The OBS-3+ puts out a simple analog signal between 0 and 2.5V.  When the
 * sensor is purchased, included in the packaging is a calibration certificate
 * to use to convert the voltage into turbidity.
 *
 * @note The 5V and 4-20mA versions of the OBS3+ are _not_ supported by this
 * library.
 *
 * The OBS3+ supports two different turbidity ranges.  The low and high range
 * signals are read independently of each other - the signals are on different
 * wires.  Each range has a separate calibrations.
 *
 * Before applying any turbidity calibration, the analog output from the OBS3+
 * must be converted into a high resolution digital signal.  See the
 * [ADS1115 page](@ref analog_group) for details on the conversion.

 *
 * @section obs3_sensor The OBS3+ Sensor
 * @note Low and high range are treated as completely independent, so only 2
 * "variables" are measured by each sensor - one for the raw voltage and another
 * for the calibrated turbidity.  To get both high and low range values, create
 * two sensor objects!

 *     - 16-bit ADC, Turbidity: 0.03125/0.125 NTU; 0.0625/0.25 NTU; 0.125/0.5 NTU
 *     - 12-bit ADC, Turbidity: 0.5/2.0 NTU; 1.0/4.0 NTU; 2.0/8.0 NTU
 *   - Reported as Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU)
 *   - Default variable code is OBS3Turbidity
 * @variabledoc{obs3_turbidity,CampbellOBS3,Turbidity,OBS3Turbidity}
 *
 * @section obs3_voltage Voltage Output
 *   - Range is 0 to 2.5V
 *   - Accuracy:
 *     - 16-bit ADC: < 0.25% (gain error), <0.25 LSB (offset errror)
 *     - 12-bit ADC: < 0.15% (gain error), <3 LSB (offset errror)
 *   - Result stored in sensorValues[1]
 *   - Resolution:
 *     - 16-bit ADC: 0.125 mV
 *     - 12-bit ADC: 2 mV
