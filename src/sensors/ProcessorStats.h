 * @section processor_intro Introduction
 *
 * The processor can return the number of "samples" it has taken, the amount of
 * RAM it has available and, for some boards, the battery voltage (EnviroDIY
 * Mayfly, Sodaq Mbili, Ndogo, Autonomo, and One, Adafruit Feathers).  The
 * version of the board is required as input (ie, for a EnviroDIY Mayfly: "v0.3"
 * or "v0.4" or "v0.5").  Use a blank value (ie, "") for un-versioned boards.
 * Please note that while you cannot opt to average more than one sample, it really
 * makes no sense to do so for the processor.  These values are only intended to be
 * used as diagnostics.

 * @section processor_sensor The Processor as a Sensor
 * @ctor_doc{ProcessorStats, const char* version}
 * @subsection processor_sensor_timing Sensor Timing
 * - Timing variables do not apply to the processor in the same way they do to
 * other sensors.
 *
 * @section processor_battery Battery Voltage
 * This is the voltage as measured on the battery attached to the MCU using the
 * inbuilt ADC, if applicable.
 * - Range is assumed to be 0 to 5V
 * - Accuracy is processor dependent
 * - Result stored in sensorValues[0]
 * - Resolution is 0.005V
 *   - 0-5V with a 10bit ADC
 * - Reported as volts (V)
 * - Default variable code is batteryVoltage
 * @variabledoc{processor_battery,ProcessorStats,Battery,batteryVoltage}
 *
 * @section processor_ram Free RAM
 * This is the amount of free space on the processor when running the program.
 * This is just a diagnostic value.  This number _**should always remain the
 * same for a single logger program**_.  If this number is not constant over
 * time, there is a memory leak and something wrong with your logging program.
 * - Range is 0 to full RAM available on processor
 * - Result stored in sensorValues[1]
 * - Resolution is 1 bit
 * - Reported in bits
 * - Default variable code is freeSRAM
 * @variabledoc{processor_ram,ProcessorStats,FreeRam,freeSRAM}
 *
 * @section processor_sampno Sample Number
 * This is a board diagnostic.  It is _**roughly**_ the number of samples
 * measured since the processor was last restarted.  This value simply
 * increments up by one every time the addSingleMeasurementResult() function is
 * called for the processor sensor.  It is intended only as a rough diagnostic
 * to show when the processor restarts.
 * - Result stored in sensorValues[2]
 * - Reported as a dimensionless sequence number
 * - Default variable code is SampNum
 * @variabledoc{processor_sampno,SampleNumber,FreeRam,SampNum}

 * ___
 * @section processor_sensor_examples Example Code
 * The processor is used as a sensor in all of the examples, including the
 * @menulink{processor_sensor} example.
